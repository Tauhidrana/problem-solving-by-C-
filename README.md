# 🧠 Problem Solving by C++

Welcome to **problem_solving_by_cpp** 🚀

This repository is a collection of **problem-solving solutions written in C++**. Each file contains a clear solution to a specific problem, helping learners improve logic, coding skills, and familiarity with C++ tools including STL.

This repo is about **practice, understanding, and growth** — not just writing code.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

* Build strong **problem-solving skills using C++**
* Practice algorithmic thinking and logic
* Apply C++ fundamentals and STL in real problems
* Prepare for exams, coding contests, and interviews
* Keep all practice code **organized in one place**

This repository is continually updated with new problems.

---

## 📚 Topics Covered

* C++ basics (loops, functions, conditions)
* STL usage (vector, map, set, stack, queue)
* Arrays and strings
* Searching techniques
* Sorting techniques
* Recursion problems
* Pattern printing
* Logical problem-solving

This repo focuses on clarity and understanding, not just code output.

## 🧠 Learning Philosophy

* Write readable, understandable code before optimization
* Learn C++ fundamentals while solving problems
* Practice consistently
* Learn from errors and debug actively

Problem-solving is **skill built through repetition and understanding**, not talent alone.

---

## 📌 Notes

* Solutions focus on clarity, not micro-optimization
* Complexity will increase gradually as you progress
* This is a **learning repository**, not a production-level library
